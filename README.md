# Space-game
Recreation of spaceship game from testing1

This is a space game project that will be created while studying Diploma of IT at Griffith College

Currently it is my second trimester and I don't have much time to fully commit into this project.
I will do some small changes throughout the months and hopefully i can finish it during a break. 

I do not have the requirements for this game set yet. 
All I have in my mind is: 
      --> Main menu with play button 
      --> Loading screen
      --> Take in name 
      --> Game screen where actual game happens
            --> have coins to gain more point or score 
            --> have hearts to gain extra life
            --> player has 3 life till game over 
      --> 0 heart = game over screen 
      --> Exit or Play again pops up 
            --> Exit goes back t o the main menu screen which allows the player to change the name
            --> Play again ==> goes back to the game screen and of course all scores will be reset to normal
