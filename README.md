# Space-game
Recreation of spaceship game from testing1

This is a space game project that will be created while studying Diploma of IT at Griffith College

Currently it is my second trimester and I don't have much time to fully commit into this project.

I will do some small changes throughout the months and hopefully i can finish it during a break.

All I have in my mind is: 
- Main menu with play button 
- Animated loading screen
- Username page
      
      - Game screen where actual game happens
      - Coins to gain more point or score 
      - Hearts to gain extra life
            - Player has 3 lives 

      - 0 heart = game over screen 
      - Exit or Play again pops up 
            --> Exit goes back t o the main menu screen which allows the player to change the name
            --> Play again ==> goes back to the game screen and of course all scores will be reset to normal
